# StringPrettifier
A framework that makes strings more readable

Why? --> I am currently working with an open API that delivers strings but these string are not correctly formatted, this framework is made to make strings that come from API more redable.

calling StringPrettifier.prettify(_ text: String) -> NSMutableAttributedString

what is included for now (07.06.2020) 
##adding break lines after "." --> website urls are avoided.
##make strings with weight "bold" if string is written with all caps.
